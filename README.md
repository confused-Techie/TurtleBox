# TurtleBox

> The Single place for a digital InfoBuffet.

TurtleBox aims to help small IT Teams tackle the amount of data that has to be sifted through daily, into a small concise dashboard. Aiming to be highly-customizable and as a framework with a small footprint, it lets the Plugins shine and do the heavy lifting to make a useful experience.

TurtleBox doesn't intend to replace or even compete with other highly advanced products/tools at IT Team's disposal, like [PDQ](), [Snipe-IT](), [Oxidized](), or [LibreNMS](). Instead TurtleBox leverages those already amazing applications, by taking their data and getting all of it in front of IT Administrators eyes in whatever format they prefer. TurtleBox allows a framework of whatever plugins you deem necessary to focus on connecting to the systems you already have in place and aggregate their data, from there TurtleBox's extremely extensible Template implementation allows customizable dashboards of data from whatever Plugins you choose, in whatever order you prefer, to let you view your data how you want.

TurtleBox is still young, and still improving, PR's are always welcome, and feedback is appreciated to improve. What system do you use that isn't available yet?
